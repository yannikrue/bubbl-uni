# bubble-uni

bubble.uni is a real-time game inspired by agar.io, where players control a circle-shaped character and compete to reach the largest size before the match ends. Up to four players can play at a time, but the game can also be played with just two players.

To gain mass in the game, players can collect *energizers* that are scattered throughout the play area. Players can also gain mass by shooting bubbles at their opponents, which will transfer some of their own mass to the opponent if it hits. However, players should be strategic with their *bubble* shots, as they will lose mass if they miss their target. As players gain mass, their character will become slower, making it easier for smaller, faster characters to avoid incoming shots or catch up to larger players.

The playfield is filled with black rectangles that act like black holes for bubbles, but serve as obstacles for the player characters. Players can use these rectangles to hide and protect themselves from incoming shots, but they must also navigate around them to pursue energizers or attack their opponents.

As the game progresses and the total mass of all players increases, the energizers will respawn less frequently, making it more difficult to gain mass later in the game. The goal of the game is to be the largest player at the end of the round, either by reaching the maximum mass or by being the largest player when the clock hits zero. By using strategic shooting and carefully collecting energizers, players can outmaneuver their opponents and emerge victorious.
